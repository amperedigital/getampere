- **Bug Fix**: Forced CSS Overrides for Mobile Layout
- Bypassed broken Tailwind `max-md:*` variants (caused by config conflict) by implementing explicit CSS media queries.
- Manually forced auto-height and relative positioning for card containers on mobile to resolve the "cut-off" issue.

- Added `data-observer` to all tab cards to utilize the existing `global.js` animation system for mobile scrolling.

## v1.569 - 2026-01-16
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed Mobile Layout Clipping & Navigation
- Updated `scroll-flipper.js` to strictly remove forced height/position styles on mobile (<768px), allowing natural vertical stacking of cards.
- Added `!important` to `max-md:!hidden` on navigation tabs to override any persistent JS styles.
- Implemented Mobile-specific `IntersectionObserver` to trigger SMIL animations on scroll since default Desktop render loop is disabled.

## v1.568 - 2026-01-16
- **Improvement**: Scroll Flipper Last Card Exception
- Prevented the last card in the stack from having its content culled/hidden, as no card exists to cover it.

## v1.567 - 2026-01-16
- **Bug Fix**: Adjusted content culling threshold in `scroll-flipper.js`.
- Fixed an issue where content faded out too early. Changed overlap threshold to ensure content stays visible until fully covered by the next card.
- Hardened selector logic to prevent opacity issues.

## v1.565 - 2026-01-15
- **Scroll Flipper Optimization: Content Culling**
- Implemented content occlusion: The text/video content of cards that are stacked behind the active card now fades to `0` opacity.

## v1.560 - 2026-01-15
- **Scroll Flipper Performance**
- Added `IntersectionObserver` sleep/wake logic. The render loop now completely stops (0 CPU) when the section is off-screen.
- Implemented "Mobile Guard" to completely disable scroll loop on mobile (<768px), fixing scrolling conflicts.
- Added dirty-checking for 3D transforms to eliminate Layout Thrashing when idle.

## v1.301 - 2026-01-12

- Implemented `max-md:overflow-y-auto` fallback for card content to prevent CTAs from being blocked by short mobile viewports.
- Enhanced modal system to use `h-auto` and `max-h-[calc(100dvh-5rem)]` on mobile, preventing browser navigation bars from obstructing modal actions.
- Maintained critical card height calculations while adding protective scrolling layers.

## v1.218 - 2026-01-09
- **Refined Card Stack Spacing**
