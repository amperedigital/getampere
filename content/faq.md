requently Asked Questions
What is an AI phone answering service?
An AI phone answering service uses artificial intelligence to answer business calls, handle bookings, qualify inquiries, and route conversations automatically.
Can AI answer business phone calls like a human?
Yes. Ampere uses natural, human-like conversations designed to sound realistic while following your business rules and escalation logic.
Is AI phone answering secure?
Ampere is built with enterprise-grade security controls, encrypted data handling, audit trails, and compliance-ready workflows.
Does Ampere replace human staff?
Ampere handles routine and high-volume calls while escalating complex or sensitive conversations to humans when needed.
How is this different from a virtual receptionist?
Unlike a virtual receptionist, Ampere manages conversations end-to-end with automation, context memory, analytics, and full visibility into outcomes.
Is this hard to set up?
No. We design, deploy, test, and configure Ampere for your business. You don’t need to build anything or change how you work.
Will it sound robotic?
No. Ampere uses natural, human-like conversations that sound realistic and adapt to how customers actually speak.
Can it transfer calls to a human?
Yes. Ampere escalates calls to the right person based on your rules, including urgency, intent, or customer context.
What if it doesn’t work for my business?
Ampere is customized around your workflows, services, and call patterns. We tailor it to how your business operates.
What happens if it doesn’t know an answer?
Ampere either escalates the call, captures the required information, or follows up — depending on your preferences.
